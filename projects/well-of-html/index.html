        <p> Squigglevision is a patented[1] method of computer animation in which the outlines of shapes are made to wiggle and undulate, emulating the effect of sketchily hand-drawn animation. Tom Snyder of Tom Snyder Productions invented the technique, which his animation studio Soup2Nuts subsequently used in <i>Dr. Katz, 
        Professional Therapist, Dick and Paula Celebrity Special, Home Movies, O'Grady, and Science Court.</i>
        Compared with traditional animation, Squigglevision is relatively fast and easy to produce. The 
        non-stop motion of the <b>"squiggling"</b> outlines reduces the need for more complex animations in order to make a scene feel dynamic. 
        Tom Snyder describes the result as "economy of motion". "There are almost no disadvantages," Snyder asserted. "It costs just as much to do a helicopter scene 
        as it does to do a living room scene."[2] However, some viewers[who?] have described Squigglevision as distracting and annoying, and some[who?] even claim Squigglevision gives 
        them headaches.[citation needed]
        <em>In order to create the line oscillation effects that characterize Squigglevision, Tom Snyder Productions' animators loop five slightly different drawings in a sequence called a flic. The animators then operate software from Avid Technology to merge the flics into the scene, 
        and synchronize them with the soundtrack.[2]</em>  </p>
